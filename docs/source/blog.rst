.. _general requirements:

* at least 600-1000 words 
* 1 internal link to a relevant content on AltcoinTrading.NET
* 1-2 links to high-trust resources

Resources can be news sites like FT or Economist, but also ideas on Tradingview as long as they have social proof.

A list form, such as a list of products, is acceptable only as long as the topic is a novelty.

.. _example:

* list-style: https://www.altcointrading.net/nft-marketplaces-open-closed-invite-code-fees/
* a deep dive: https://www.altcointrading.net/scriptspotlight-volume-profile-trading-fixed-visible-range/
